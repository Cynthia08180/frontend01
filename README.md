## 🚀 About Me
My name is Wong Chak Yung. I'm an exchange student come from Taiwan. In my Home University, I am doing a project about goblin mode.

Therefore, I thought I can do a wesite to introduce what my project is about.


# Goblin mode

Oxford University Press recently announced the 2022 word of the year as voted on by more than 300,000 people—"goblin mode."

“Goblin mode” embodies the idea of owning who you are, taking care of your needs, and living more authentically.
